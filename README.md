# MachineLearning-methods-on-Rainfall-Data-of-India
An application of machine learning methods like regression and classification project on rainfall dataset of India using different models.

This was a project to learn and apply different aspects of machine learning like regression, classification and clustering.

The dataset used for the project contains data about the rainfall in India of over 100+ years. We preprocessed the data and also generated custom datasets from it for applying different algorithms.

#### Installation & Requirements

Requires python 3.x.x or higher.

i. Clone the repository on a local machine.
ii. Opean a terminal and install the requirements using: pip install -r requirements.txt
iii. Run the project using: python Rainfall.py

The results and plots for the different alogrithms will be printed on the console.

## Algorithms applied:

### Regression

We used to original dataset after preprocessing to apply regression methods like Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, etc.

### Classification & Clustering

We generated a custom dataset and added classes depending on the annual rainfall of a sub-division as SCANTY, LOW, MODERATE, HEAVY rainfall region.

Classifiers like SVM, RandomForests, etc and K-means clustering algorithms were trained and tested to classify sub-divisions into these regions based on the rainfall they receive.

## Results

Sample results are stored in the Results directory of the repository.
